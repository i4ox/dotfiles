-- This is my personal NeoVim configuration supporting Linux, and maybe Windows and Mac, with various plugins configured.
-- This configuration evolves as I learn more about NeoVim and become more proficient in using NeoVim.
-- I would not recommend cloning this configuration and replace your own config. Good configuration are personal, build over time with a lot of polish
